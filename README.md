LETS BUILD AWESOME MOBILE APPS USING THE EASIEST WAY

A write less, do more library for Android. Andbrain Engine makes your code more concise and development simpler by using annotations
Andbrain is mainly used to

make coding clean and simple

especially in cases where you deal with complex layout.The reason behind it is andbrain parse all layout files and

automatically generates

 all input controls like TextView’s, EditText’s, Button’s , ImageView’s .and instantiate all this views using annotations,  You can use it for events too ,that eases the process of injecting InputEvents OnClick,OnTouch,MotionEvent, KeyEvent,… into your classes automatically.
and you can use a pair of annotations called @Background and @UIThread which magically allowed your code to be executed on the UI Thread or on a Background with no effort.This means that the library writes common boilerplate code for you based on annotations to

save your time and makes your code more concise and development simpler

Andbrain engine significantly reduce the lines of boilerplate code written making use of “Annotation Processing”

at compile time itself

which means there is

no additional cost at run-time

and keep in your mind that Andbrain doesn’t slow down your App, it gives the same result as when you declare your views manually
